This is a sensor platform based on Android.

The idea is that:

- java is a more accessible language than embedded C to the masses
- the Android platform takes care of a lot of the subsystem / OS things for us
- we can get ARM9 based Android boards online for around 80 bucks
- we want to take modular components that are well defined and build off of those components


Intenton and Audience

- we make no allusions that this is a production grade codebase
- its meant as a prototype to work out ideas, more hackeration than anything
- its meant for anyone who'd like to duct tape a few pieces together and try out some sensor ideas
- code should be accessible to 2nd year comp sci students or curious hackers


Origin of the name "Cephenes"

Cephenes is latin for the "drones in bee hive"
